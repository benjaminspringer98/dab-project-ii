# Designing and Building Scalable Web Applications - Course Project II

This project was completed as part of the module Designing and Building Scalable
Web Applications, in the autumn term 2023, at Aalto University.

- General information on the application and corresponding design decisions can be found in REFLECTION.md
- Information on running the application can be found in RUNNING.md
- Decisions regarding the database are explained in DATABASE.md
- Starting the application up for the first time may take a while, as it also downloads a large language model (small with poor quality responses) (approx. 250 megabytes) and packages it into an image.
